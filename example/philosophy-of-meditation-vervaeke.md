00:16:33,000 --> 00:17:24,000
    == ' philosophy as therapy', %0.7925502316753369
epistemology? can help metaphysically terms questions is continental phenomenology, meditation phenomenology very know probably these because there's 26 are section. four, meditation phenomenology. Right. there's there, Staneshwar Tumalsina, Vedantic scholar brilliant about phenomenology like,

00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
    == ' philosophy as therapy', %0.7952718447896213
right, contextual norms arenas, the critics defenders space. but the So these context philosophers, communicating other, norms, right? Charitable interpretation, critical careful of disagreement. norms they're as what deep get deep about meditation philosophy very great almost exercise philosophy kind practice.
 
27
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:39,000

    == ' the inner self as experience', %0.8057398099376354
self-creation, is self-creation. So these self-transcendent transcendent the oxymoron. yet constantly across sapiential including tradition, of cetera, radical fair paradox?
